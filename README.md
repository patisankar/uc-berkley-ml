## Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is foundational to ML/AI, enabling efficient data representation, manipulation, and computation.

Specifically:

Vectors and matrices store data and model parameters, while operations such as matrix multiplication power neural networks during training and inference.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are key in dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), which simplify high-dimensional data for better analysis.
Matrix decompositions such as SVD are crucial for recommendation systems and text analysis tasks.
Linear transformations facilitate image processing and computer vision by scaling, rotating, or translating data.
Additionally, natural language processing applications use word embeddings represented as vectors to capture semantic relationships among words. From predicting house prices with linear regression to enabling deep learning models for speech recognition or image classification, linear algebra is the backbone of modern AI technologies.


## calculs
Calculus plays a central role in how ML models learn:
Most training involves minimizing a cost function – a measure of how wrong the model is – using derivatives to guide adjustments.
In neural networks, algorithms such as gradient descent use derivatives to update weights in the direction that reduces error.
In linear and logistic regression, calculus helps find the optimal coefficients by minimizing the loss.
In reinforcement learning, calculus optimizes policies that maximize long-term rewards.
